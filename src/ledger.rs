//! Async client for the ledger's audit and verify endpoints.
//!
//! Six calls cover the operator's reconstruction surface:
//!
//! * [`LedgerClient::audit_correlation`] — the per-request join, used
//!   to pull every layer's row for a single original request. Each
//!   successful request lands two rows in the chain (proxy + policy);
//!   this is what stitches them.
//! * [`LedgerClient::audit_agent`] — every row in the chain that
//!   names a given agent CN, oldest first. Full-chain fetch — fine
//!   for compliance batch tooling.
//! * [`LedgerClient::audit_agent_paged`] — newest-first
//!   `?limit=&offset=` slice of the same data. Used by UI callers so
//!   memory scales with `per_page`, not chain depth.
//! * [`LedgerClient::audit_agent_count`] — total chain rows for the
//!   agent; pairs with `audit_agent_paged` to drive a paginated UI's
//!   total-pages count without a full row read.
//! * [`LedgerClient::verify`] — recompute every hash and check that
//!   the chain links up. Returns a [`VerifyResult`] mirroring what the
//!   server emits.
//! * [`LedgerClient::list_exports`] — bookkeeping list of cold-tier
//!   snapshots written so far (Parquet + manifest pointers). The
//!   console renders this as a browse-able table so operators don't
//!   have to `curl` the ledger directly.
